--- 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM ---

Focused on getting the default project stuff set up (love.load, love.update, love.load)

Set screen size to 1920x1080

Added functionality for Love2D to close when the "ESC" key is pressed

Started creating a makeScene() function that can be used to create different scenes (will be used to create title screen, levels, etc.)
This function returns a scene table that holds all of the necessary components of the scene
    Added a makeButton() function inside of scene tables so that buttons can be created (useful for titlescreen buttons and maybe some inventory menus)
    This function creates a button table that holds all of the necessary information for the button (background color, text, functions, etc.)
    Each button has a draw() function to display it on the screen
    Every button that is made is added to a list of buttons within the scene

Created a getCurrentColor() function that returns the current color being drawn with.

Created a mouseInObject() function that determines whether the mouse cursor is inside of an object or not.


--- 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM ---
Continued working on the makeScene() and makeButton() functions.

makeButton() no longer adds the newly created button to a table. Instead, it now returns the button.

makeScene() now also inserts the newly created scene into a list of scenes in addition to returning the scene.

Added an activeScene variable that keeps track of what the current scene is.
Added a for loop at the beginning of love.update to iterate through all the scenes, check which scene's active value is true, and then set activeScene equal the index of whichever scene is active.

Created font and fontSize variables to be used throughout the file.

Started working on the love.mousepressed() function, a scene.mousepressed() function, a button.isPressed() function


-- 8:00 PM to 8:45 PM --
Finished working on the love.mousepressed() function, scene.mousepressed() function, and the button.isPressed() function.

Added comments for clarity in all of my code.

Started working on an isMouseHovering() function and a button.mouseHovering() function.

Hours Worked Today: 1 hours and 40 minutes
Total Hours Worked: 4 hours and 25 minutes

--- 4:20 PM to 6:00 PM ---

Continued working on the isMouseHovering() function and the button.mouseHovering() function.
Finished the isMouseHovering() function and the button.mouseHovering() function.

Added button.sfx that would play every time the button is clicked.

Separated the scene making code into a separate sceneMaker.lua file.

Added a backgroundMusic field to the scene being created in the makeScene() function.

Considering adding a scene.play() function that handles all of the logic for the scene, but I might not do it because it might be easier to define those in main.lua in the update function.

Removed the activeScene variable. The scenes table that holds all scenes in main.lua now stores each scene in a key value (such as scenes.titlescreen).

Played around with functionality to see if I could make clicking a button transition from one scene to the next (I was able to)

Things to do next time: 
- Find title screen background music
